## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork and create a feature branch:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rustemr.git
   cd rustemr
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Follow coding guidelines:

   - Rust code: `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`.
   - Frontend: `npm run lint`.
   - Write tests and ensure they pass (`cargo test`, `npm test`).
