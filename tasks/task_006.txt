# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop FHIR API integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement FHIR-compliant API endpoints for interoperability with external healthcare systems.
# Details:
Research and implement FHIR resource mappings for Patient, Encounter, Observation, and other relevant resources. Create adapter layer to transform between internal data models and FHIR resources. Implement FHIR API endpoints following RESTful principles. Support common FHIR operations including search, read, create, update. Implement FHIR validation using official specifications. Add content negotiation for different formats (JSON, XML). Document FHIR capabilities in a CapabilityStatement.

# Test Strategy:
Validate FHIR resources against official schemas. Test interoperability with sample FHIR clients. Verify search parameters work according to FHIR specifications. Test content negotiation with different formats. Ensure proper error responses for invalid requests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create FHIR resource mapping layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a mapping layer that transforms internal data models to FHIR resources and vice versa
### Details:
Implement adapter classes for each required FHIR resource (Patient, Encounter, Observation, etc.). Each adapter should: 1) Convert internal model to FHIR resource with proper element mapping, 2) Support conversion from FHIR resource back to internal model, 3) Include validation against FHIR specifications, 4) Handle versioning appropriately. Use the official FHIR SDK for your programming language. Create unit tests to verify bidirectional mapping accuracy. Document the mapping relationships between internal models and FHIR resources.

## 2. Implement core FHIR API endpoints and operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop RESTful API endpoints that support basic FHIR operations for the mapped resources
### Details:
Create API endpoints following FHIR RESTful conventions for each resource type. Implement the core FHIR interactions: read (GET /{resourceType}/{id}), search (GET /{resourceType}?parameters), create (POST /{resourceType}), update (PUT /{resourceType}/{id}), and delete if applicable. Add support for common search parameters for each resource. Implement proper HTTP status codes and error handling according to FHIR specifications. Set up content negotiation to support both JSON and XML formats using appropriate MIME types. Add request/response logging for debugging. Create integration tests for each endpoint.

## 3. Finalize FHIR compliance and documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Complete FHIR validation, advanced features, and create comprehensive documentation
### Details:
Implement advanced FHIR features: support for _include and _revinclude parameters, handling of conditional operations, and implementing _history operations where appropriate. Create a CapabilityStatement (conformance resource) that accurately describes the implemented resources, operations, and search parameters. Set up automated FHIR validation using official validation tools. Implement security features including authentication and authorization for FHIR endpoints. Create comprehensive API documentation with examples for each supported operation. Develop a test suite that verifies compliance with FHIR specifications. Add monitoring for API usage and performance.
