# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement authentication and authorization system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a secure authentication system with role-based access control for healthcare providers, administrators, and patients.
# Details:
Implement JWT-based authentication in the Rust backend. Create user management with secure password hashing using bcrypt or Argon2. Design role-based access control (RBAC) system with predefined roles (admin, physician, nurse, patient, etc.). Implement middleware for route protection based on user roles. Create database tables for users, roles, and permissions. Implement session management with appropriate timeouts for healthcare context. Add audit logging for authentication events.

# Test Strategy:
Test login/logout flows. Verify role-based access restrictions. Perform security testing including password policies, brute force protection, and session handling. Ensure compliance with healthcare security standards.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement user authentication with JWT [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core authentication system with JWT token generation, validation, and user credential management

## 2. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) system [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Design and implement the RBAC system with predefined healthcare roles and permissions
