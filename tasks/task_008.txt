# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement clinical encounter UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop frontend components for managing clinical encounters, recording vital signs, diagnoses, and treatments.
# Details:
Create encounter creation and editing forms. Implement vital signs recording interface with appropriate input validation. Develop diagnosis search and selection using ICD-10 codes. Build treatment documentation forms. Create encounter timeline view for patient history. Implement clinical notes editor with formatting options. Add file upload capability for clinical attachments. Ensure all forms follow healthcare UX best practices with clear labeling and error states.

# Test Strategy:
Test encounter workflow from creation to completion. Verify vital signs validation with boundary testing. Test diagnosis search functionality. Ensure all clinical data is correctly saved and retrieved. Perform usability testing with healthcare professionals if possible.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create encounter creation and editing forms with vital signs recording [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core encounter forms that allow healthcare providers to create new encounters and edit existing ones, including the vital signs recording interface.
### Details:
Implement a form component for creating and editing clinical encounters with fields for encounter type, date/time, provider, and location. Add a vital signs section with appropriate input fields for temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, height, weight, and BMI calculation. Implement client-side validation for all vital sign inputs with appropriate ranges and units. Ensure form layout follows healthcare UX best practices with clear labeling, grouping of related fields, and informative error states. Include save, cancel, and delete actions with appropriate confirmation dialogs.

## 2. Implement diagnosis and treatment documentation components [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create the UI components for searching, selecting, and documenting diagnoses using ICD-10 codes, and for recording treatments prescribed during the encounter.
### Details:
Develop a diagnosis search component that allows users to search for ICD-10 codes by keyword or code number with autocomplete functionality. Implement a selected diagnoses list with primary/secondary designation options. Create treatment documentation forms with fields for medications (name, dosage, frequency, duration), procedures, and other interventions. Include appropriate validation for all treatment fields. Design the components to be integrated into the main encounter form created in subtask 1, but implement them as separate, reusable components that can be tested independently.

## 3. Develop clinical notes editor and encounter timeline view [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create a rich text editor for clinical notes and a timeline view to display patient encounter history, including file attachment capabilities.
### Details:
Implement a clinical notes editor with basic text formatting options (bold, italic, lists, headings) and templates for common note structures (SOAP, etc.). Add file upload functionality for clinical attachments with preview capabilities for images and PDFs, ensuring proper validation for file types and sizes. Create an encounter timeline component that chronologically displays a patient's encounter history with filtering options by encounter type, provider, or date range. Implement a detailed view mode that expands to show complete encounter information when selected. Ensure all components follow accessibility guidelines and responsive design principles to work on various device sizes.
