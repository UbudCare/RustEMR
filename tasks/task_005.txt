# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement encounter tracking system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop API endpoints and business logic for tracking patient encounters, including visits, vital signs, diagnoses, and treatments.
# Details:
Create data models for encounters, vital signs, diagnoses (using standard coding systems like ICD-10), and treatments. Implement API endpoints for managing encounter data. Develop business logic for encounter workflows, including validation rules. Create relationships between encounters and patients. Implement date-based querying for encounter history. Add support for encounter notes and attachments. Ensure proper authorization checks for clinical data access.

# Test Strategy:
Test encounter creation, update, and retrieval workflows. Verify vital signs recording with valid ranges. Test diagnosis coding validation. Ensure encounter history is correctly maintained. Verify authorization rules for different user roles accessing clinical data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create data models and database schema for encounter system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core data models for the encounter tracking system, including database schema, relationships, and validation rules
### Details:
Create the following models with appropriate relationships: 1) Encounter model with fields for date, type, status, and patient reference; 2) VitalSigns model linked to encounters with fields for common measurements (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, etc.); 3) Diagnosis model using ICD-10 coding system with severity and status fields; 4) Treatment model with fields for procedures, medications, and instructions; 5) EncounterNote model for clinical documentation; 6) EncounterAttachment model for file uploads. Implement proper foreign key relationships between all models and the existing Patient model. Add appropriate indexes for performance, especially for date-based queries. Include validation rules for required fields and data formats.

## 2. Implement API endpoints for encounter management [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop RESTful API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and querying encounter data and related clinical information
### Details:
Create the following API endpoints: 1) POST /api/encounters for creating new encounters; 2) GET /api/encounters/:id for retrieving specific encounters with optional include parameters for related data; 3) PUT /api/encounters/:id for updating encounters; 4) GET /api/patients/:id/encounters for retrieving a patient's encounter history with filtering options by date range and type; 5) POST endpoints for adding vital signs, diagnoses, treatments, notes and attachments to encounters; 6) Implement pagination for list endpoints; 7) Add filtering capabilities for date ranges and encounter types; 8) Include proper error handling and validation responses. Document all endpoints using OpenAPI/Swagger.

## 3. Develop business logic and authorization for encounter workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Implement the business rules, workflow logic, and security controls for the encounter tracking system
### Details:
Implement the following business logic components: 1) Encounter state management with appropriate status transitions (scheduled, in-progress, completed, cancelled); 2) Validation rules for clinical data entry (e.g., vital signs within reasonable ranges, required fields based on encounter type); 3) Authorization middleware to restrict access based on user roles (doctors, nurses, administrative staff) with specific rules for who can view/edit different parts of encounters; 4) Audit logging for all changes to encounter data; 5) Business rules for encounter workflows (e.g., required diagnoses before closing an encounter, validation of treatment conflicts); 6) Integration with notification system to alert relevant staff about new or updated encounters; 7) Implement data export functionality for encounter summaries. Include comprehensive unit and integration tests for all business logic.
