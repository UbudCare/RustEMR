# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement CI/CD and deployment configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Set up continuous integration, testing, and deployment pipelines for the RustEMR project.
# Details:
Configure GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD service for automated testing. Set up separate pipelines for backend and frontend. Implement automated testing for Rust (cargo test) and React (npm test). Configure linting checks (clippy for Rust, ESLint for TypeScript). Create Docker compose files for production deployment. Implement database migration automation for deployments. Set up staging and production environments. Create backup and restore procedures for the PostgreSQL database. Document deployment process and requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Verify CI pipeline by making test commits with passing and failing tests. Test deployment to staging environment. Perform database migration testing with sample data. Test backup and restore procedures. Verify that the deployed application functions correctly in a production-like environment.
