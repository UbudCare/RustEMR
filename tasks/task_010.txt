# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement CI/CD and deployment configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Set up continuous integration, testing, and deployment pipelines for the RustEMR project.
# Details:
Configure GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD service for automated testing. Set up separate pipelines for backend and frontend. Implement automated testing for Rust (cargo test) and React (npm test). Configure linting checks (clippy for Rust, ESLint for TypeScript). Create Docker compose files for production deployment. Implement database migration automation for deployments. Set up staging and production environments. Create backup and restore procedures for the PostgreSQL database. Document deployment process and requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Verify CI pipeline by making test commits with passing and failing tests. Test deployment to staging environment. Perform database migration testing with sample data. Test backup and restore procedures. Verify that the deployed application functions correctly in a production-like environment.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up CI pipelines with automated testing and linting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration with automated testing and code quality checks for both backend and frontend components
### Details:
Create GitHub Actions workflow files (.github/workflows/) with separate jobs for backend and frontend. For backend (Rust): configure cargo test, cargo clippy, and code coverage. For frontend (React/TypeScript): set up npm test, ESLint, and TypeScript type checking. Ensure workflows run on pull requests and main branch commits. Configure caching for dependencies to speed up CI runs. Set up status checks to prevent merging failing PRs. Document the CI process in the project README.

## 2. Create Docker configuration for development and production [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop Docker and Docker Compose configurations for consistent development environments and production deployment
### Details:
Create Dockerfiles for backend and frontend services. Develop docker-compose.yml for local development with hot-reloading. Create docker-compose.prod.yml for production deployment with optimized builds. Configure PostgreSQL container with volume mounts for data persistence. Set up environment variable management for different environments. Implement database initialization and migration scripts that run on container startup. Document Docker setup and usage in a DEPLOYMENT.md file.

## 3. Implement CD pipeline with staging/production environments and database management [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Configure continuous deployment workflows with separate staging and production environments, including database migration automation and backup procedures
### Details:
Extend GitHub Actions workflows to include deployment jobs for staging and production environments. Implement environment-specific configuration management. Set up automated database migrations as part of the deployment process using a migration tool like Diesel. Create database backup scripts that run on a schedule and before migrations. Implement database restore procedures and document recovery process. Configure secrets management for sensitive information. Set up monitoring and alerting for deployment failures. Create comprehensive deployment documentation covering the entire CI/CD pipeline, environment setup, and database management procedures.
