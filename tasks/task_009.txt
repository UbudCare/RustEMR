# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create comprehensive documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop user, developer, and API documentation for the RustEMR system.
# Details:
Create installation and setup guide covering all prerequisites. Write developer documentation explaining the codebase structure and architecture. Document API endpoints with request/response examples. Create user manual for clinical staff with screenshots and workflows. Document FHIR implementation details and capabilities. Create contribution guidelines following the project's standards. Generate API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI for REST endpoints. Include database schema documentation with entity relationships.

# Test Strategy:
Verify documentation accuracy by following installation steps on a clean system. Have developers review technical documentation for accuracy. Test API examples to ensure they work as documented. Have non-technical users review user documentation for clarity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create user and installation documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop comprehensive user documentation and installation guides for the RustEMR system
### Details:
Create an installation and setup guide covering all prerequisites, system requirements, and configuration steps. Develop a detailed user manual for clinical staff that includes screenshots, common workflows, and troubleshooting tips. Organize content into logical sections (Getting Started, Daily Operations, Advanced Features). Include a FAQ section addressing common questions. Format documentation using Markdown for easy maintenance and convert to PDF for distribution. Test installation procedures on different environments to ensure accuracy.

## 2. Develop technical and developer documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for developers explaining the system architecture, codebase structure, and contribution guidelines
### Details:
Document the codebase structure with directory explanations and architecture diagrams. Create detailed documentation of the database schema showing entity relationships and data models. Write contribution guidelines that follow the project's coding standards, pull request process, and testing requirements. Include documentation on the FHIR implementation details and capabilities. Add setup instructions for development environments. Create troubleshooting guides for common development issues. Use diagrams to illustrate system architecture and component interactions.

## 3. Generate API documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Document all API endpoints with request/response examples and implement Swagger/OpenAPI integration
### Details:
Implement Swagger/OpenAPI for automatic REST endpoint documentation. Document each API endpoint with detailed descriptions, required parameters, authentication requirements, and possible response codes. Include request and response examples for each endpoint in multiple formats (JSON, XML). Document rate limiting and security considerations. Create a postman collection for testing API endpoints. Ensure documentation includes error handling and troubleshooting information. Implement interactive API documentation that allows testing endpoints directly from the documentation interface.
