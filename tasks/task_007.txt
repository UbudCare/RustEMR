# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create React frontend for patient management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the React/TypeScript frontend components for patient registration, search, and profile management.
# Details:
Set up React component library (Material-UI or Chakra UI recommended for healthcare UIs). Implement responsive layouts for desktop and mobile viewing. Create patient registration forms with validation. Develop patient search interface with filters. Build patient profile view with demographic information. Implement state management using React Context or Redux. Create API service layer for communication with backend. Add form validation matching backend requirements. Implement error handling and user notifications.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library. Test form validation logic. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes. Test API integration with mock services. Conduct usability testing with sample users.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up React project with UI library and core architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the React/TypeScript project, integrate the chosen UI component library, and establish the core application architecture
### Details:
Create a new React/TypeScript project using Create React App or Vite. Install and configure either Material-UI or Chakra UI as the component library. Set up the project structure with folders for components, services, hooks, and utilities. Implement the base layout components for responsive design (header, navigation, main content area, footer). Configure routing using React Router with placeholder routes for patient registration, search, and profile pages. Establish the state management approach using either React Context API or Redux, creating the initial store structure for patient data. Set up a basic API service layer with axios or fetch for future backend communication.

## 2. Implement patient registration and search components [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop the patient registration form with validation and the patient search interface with filtering capabilities
### Details:
Create a multi-step patient registration form with fields for personal information, contact details, medical history, and insurance information. Implement form validation using Formik or React Hook Form with Yup schema validation matching backend requirements. Add client-side validation for all fields (required fields, email format, phone numbers, etc.). Create the patient search component with filters for name, ID, date of birth, and other relevant criteria. Implement the search results display with pagination and sorting options. Add loading states and error handling for both registration and search components. Connect these components to the state management system established in subtask 1. Create mock data and services for development and testing purposes.

## 3. Develop patient profile management and API integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Build the patient profile view and complete the API integration with the backend
### Details:
Create the patient profile view component displaying demographic information, medical history, appointments, and other relevant patient data. Implement edit functionality for patient information with the same validation as the registration form. Add features for managing patient status (active/inactive) and handling special cases. Complete the API service layer by implementing all required endpoints for patient CRUD operations. Connect all components to the real API endpoints, replacing mock data. Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly notifications using a toast or alert system. Add loading states and optimistic UI updates for better user experience. Implement proper authentication token handling for API requests. Create unit and integration tests for all components. Optimize performance with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback where appropriate.
